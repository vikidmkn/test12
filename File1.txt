The bastion was quiet at night.
A lantern flickered in the tower.
Shadows moved behind the curtain.

The keep was quiet at night.
A lantern flickered in the tower.
Someone moved behind the curtain.

The river flowed very gently.
It reflected the moonlight.
Nearby, an owl hooted.
The forest seemed alive.

The old book lay on the table.
Its pages were yellowed and torn.

A note fell out as it was opened.

A card fell out as it was opened.

Where could it lead?
